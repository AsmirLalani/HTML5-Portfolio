<h1>The Best Animated Movies According to Asmir</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cars</h3>
<p>Racing, redemption, and a heartwarming story of friendship. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece and anyone that disagrees probably probably liked watching National Geographic as a kid.</p>
<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>As much as I don't support parents that can't keep track of their kids, Marvin abandoning his child led to one of the most iconic animated movies of all time. Nemo single-handedly brought back the demand for clownfish at every pet store across America.</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>If you thought you couldn't get emotional watching an animated movie, you haven't seen Inside Out. Bing Bong's sacrifice still brings a tear to my eye. Top 3 movie deaths of all time and it's not even close. </p>
