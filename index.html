    <h1>Hi, I'm Asmir!</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio site, coded entirely with <strong>HTML5</strong>. This site is a result of a coding project in my ongoing efforts to learn how to code! Feel free to browse and reach out. To see my current (and honestly, much better looking) portfolio site, please visit <a href="https://www.asmirlalani.com">www.AsmirLalani.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Check out my Projects!</h2>

    <p>While this portfolio site in its own is a project to show my expertise in HTML5, I've also been tasked to complete other projects throughout the course that I've been working through. You can check out the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING">here</a>.</p>
