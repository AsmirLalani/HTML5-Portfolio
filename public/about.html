<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>They say that a <b>Jack of all Trades is to be a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.</b></p>

  <p>Nice to meet you, I'm Jack, but my friends and family like to call me <b>Asmir</b> for some reason. </p>
  
  <p>Over last decade, I have dedicated my career to learning and utilizing all kinds of new skills ranging from personalized clothing creation to managing sales and marketing campaigns for best-selling authors.

  I focus on helping businesses find creative solutions to help their businesses stand out amongst the rest, whether it be reimagining your brand or analyzing why a product isn't selling as expected. 
  </p>

<p>Outside of my career life, I am inconsistently consistent in the gym, writing on my blog titled <a href="https://www.asmirlalani.com/focusedoneverything"><b>"Focused on Everything"</b></a>, spending time with my family/friends, or reading something (yes, something. Could be a book, could be the back of a milk carton. Just depends on the day really).
</p>

<p>Chances are, you're running into this site in it's very beginning phases, so if you are, welcome! This site is part of my ongoing effort to learn how to code. For this project, I was tasked to create a portfolio site from scratch using nothing but <b>HTML5</b>.</p> 

<p>Feel free to check back whenever to see the progress! </p>

<p>- Asmir Lalani (Not Jack, that was definitely a joke)</p>
